# Project Goal
The goal of this project is to give practice implementing different planning and control algorithms. The objective is to write a planner to guide a robot through a
warehouse to retrieve and deliver packages. The warehouse will have a continuous representation, and the robot will have to navigate carefully around corners to avoid crashing into them.

Here the robot is identified by the blue circle in the green block, the packages are identified as small red squares and the brown blocks represents obstacles in the grid world.
