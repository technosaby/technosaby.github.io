description: "This project implements tracking methods for image sequences and videos. The main algorithms used here are the Kalman and Particle Filters.
This project focusses on these objectives:
* Identify which image processing methods work best in order to locate an object in a scene.
* Learn to how object tracking in images works.
* Explore different methods to build a tracking algorithm that relies on measurements and a prior state.
* Create methods that can track an object when occlusions are present in the scene."
