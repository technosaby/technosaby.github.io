title: "Marker Detection"
tagline: "Augmented Reality using techniques like Projective geometry, Corner detection, Perspective imaging, and Homographies" 
descriptions: "This project introduces basic concepts behind Augmented Reality using techniques like Projective geometry, Corner detection, Perspective imaging, and Homographies. Also the project introduces concept of video editing by learn how to read from a video, process each video frame by identifying important features, insert images within images, and assemble a video from a sequence of frames.

The learning objectives are as follows:
* Find markers using circle and corner detection, convolution, and / or pattern recognition
* Learn how projective geometry can be used to transform a sample image from one plane to another.
* Address the marker recognition problem when there is noise in the scene.
* Implement backwards (reverse) warping.
* Understand how video can be extracted in sequences of images, and replace specific areas of each image with different content.
* Assemble a video from a sequence of images."

# Project Goal
This project introduces basic concepts behind Augmented Reality using techniques like Projective geometry, Corner detection, Perspective imaging, and Homographies. Also the project introduces concept of video editing by learn how to read from a video, process each video frame by identifying important features, insert images within images, and assemble a video from a sequence of frames.

The learning objectives are as follows:
* Find markers using circle and corner detection, convolution, and / or pattern recognition
* Learn how projective geometry can be used to transform a sample image from one plane to another.
* Address the marker recognition problem when there is noise in the scene.
* Implement backwards (reverse) warping.
* Understand how video can be extracted in sequences of images, and replace specific areas of each image with different content.
* Assemble a video from a sequence of images.
