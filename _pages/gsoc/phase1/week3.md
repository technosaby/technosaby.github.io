description: "Learning Curve Analysis for 2 datasets using Supervised Learning algorithms. This project analyses 2 classification problems. The idea is not to find correct hyperparameters for the datasets, rather to do the learning curve analysis for each of the datasets and model them using different algorithms like Artificial Neural Nets, Decision Trees, kNN, Boosting"
