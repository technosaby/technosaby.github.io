## Ambitions
1. Work on the developing the codebook for the tags
2. Work on developing a script for filtering tags from the metadata output file

## Details
1. I have developed a codebook which will contains all the tags listed in one place. The idea is to upload this to RedHen's website after review.
2. I also built a filtering script which will read the generated metatdata file (sfx), filter a tag within a certain timeframe and generate the output in a csv file.

## Next Steps
1. I am waiting for review of work from mentors 
2. Decide the next steps of transfer learning
