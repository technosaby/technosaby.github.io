## Ambitions
 1. Finalise the singularity
 2. Discuss with mentors to finalise the next path
 
## Details
1. I have prepared the singularity container and had a review with Ahmed (my second mentor). He suggested some minor changes. But my singularity container is ready.
2. The work to be done in the HPC is done in the form of a [script](https://github.com/technosaby/gsoc2022/blob/main/hpc_script.sh)
3. I had a discussion with Austin about the next steps of the project for the next 1 month and after.
  - In the next 1 month of the GSOC, we should try to port the SFX file to ELAN by converting into an EAF file. If we are able to do this, it will be a great help for the research community. Also we can write a paper about the same in the Linguistic Vanguard.
  - If the ELAN does not work, the idea is to try out other Audio tagging libraries and see their performance along with YamNet.
  - Also we have to check all the new papers written in the Audio Tagging and see if we can write a new paper after doing some modifications with the existing models. This can also result in a paper. 

## Next Week Targets
1. Convert SFX to EAF file for ELAN portbility.
