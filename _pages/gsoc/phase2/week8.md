## Ambitions
1. Finalise the ssfx script
2. Review with mentors and decide the next steps

## Details
I had a review with mentor with week. They have set the priorities for the next phase of work.
1. Generate a TOP section for files without .seg.
2. Finalise the codebook for reference
3. Generate an advanced filtering mechanism to filter results for certain sound tags.
4. Package code in Singularity container
5. Check if it is possible to use the RedHen pipeline for audio processing
6. Check for transfer learning and improving the result.

## Strategies
I have finished the first 2 sections above. Now I am studying tools to generate the filtering. Austin has suggested to use [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), which I am studying now. By the next week I plan to have my filtering output implemented and reviewed by mentors.
