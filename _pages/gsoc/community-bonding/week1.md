This is the first week of the GSoc. Redhen is collecting the details about mentors and contributers and they are being recorded [here](
at https://sites.google.com/site/distributedlittleredhen/summer-of-code/red-hen-lab-gsoc-2022-projects).
They are also creating accounts for us in the Case Western Reserve University to access the HPC (high performance clusters). Most of the contributers from this year will do the work in these clusters so that they can be demonstrated in the RedHen platform. After that they are planning to do mass zoom meeting to start the program for this year. 

GSoc team at Google, has also planned a virtual summit which aims to inspire and inform contributors. There will be talks from Googlers, GSoC mentors and former contributors who will share their personal and professional GSoC and open source journeys.

This week I also did the following:
- Study about Yamnet
- Understand other Audio Classification Use cases
- Blog about Yamnet classification with all understanding
