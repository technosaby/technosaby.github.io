This week I am setting up the singularity container by following this [link](https://sites.google.com/case.edu/techne-public-site/singularity). A great reference about singularity is also found from Yunfei's [blog](https://blog.yunfeizhao.com/2021/05/30/GSOC1-singularity/) who was also a RedHen contributer in GSoc 2021. 


## Ambitions
- Discuss the use cases and goals
- Discuss scope of project with mentors
- Set up a communication channel (async)
- Discuss timelines and expectations 

## Ideas
- Use slack (or something ?) for communication with students/past students/mentors ?


## Challenges
- Faced small issues in setting up the docker with Github actions. Fixed it with setting the submodules as recursive 
- Singularity container does not direct me to the gallina home, rather diverts me to /tmp. Need to check this issue.

## Details


## Strategies
- In case of blockers search for previous students blogs.


## Setbacks


## Successes 
- Successful in running the docker through github actions
- Also able to access singularity file in the case hpc.
